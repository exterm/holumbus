        \the query as well as some suggestions on how the words from the query could be completed. \
        \Clicking one of these suggestions will replace the according word in the query."
    p $ do
      text "Hayoo! displays results as a list of functions, including full qualified module name and the \
        \function signature. Clicking the function name will lead directly to the corresponding documentation \
        \while clicking the module name will lead to the documentation of the module. Additionally, Hayoo! \
        \shows the function description (if available) and provides a link leading directly to the source \
        \of the function (if available). The description of the function can be expanded by clicking on \
        \the small '+' sign."

        \Instead of using whitespace, the explicit "

      text " will prefer hits from the base package. But the restriction can also be more explicit, like "

      text " or like "
      span' [A.class_ "query"] $ text "map module:data.list"

      span' [A.class_ "query"] $ text "fold module:(data.list OR data.map)"

    p $ do
      text "Hayoo! always performs fuzzy queries. This means, it tries to find something even if the \
        \query contains spelling errors. For example, Hayoo! will still find \"fold\" if \"fodl\" is \
        \being searched. If Hayoo! detects \">\" in the query string, it will only search for signatures. \
        \A signature query may consist of explicit type names as well as type variables. For example, \
