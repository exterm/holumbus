About
-----

Hayoo! is a highly interactive Haskell API search engine, providing
sophisticated features like find-as-you-type, suggestions and
fuzzy queries.

Requirements
------------

- Holumbus 0.4
- Janus 1.0

Installation
------------

Unfortunately, the installation is quite fiddly. In the following,
the exact procedure is described in detail.

1. Download the Janus application server and unzip in a directory
   of your choice.
   
2. Download the Holumbus framework and unzip in a directory of
   your choice. Follow the included installation instructions to
   install the Holumbus core library.

3. Copy the following files from the examples/hayoo directory into
   the Janus directory:
   
   HayooHelper.hs -> src/HayooHelper.hs
   search/HayooParser.hs -> src/HayooParser.hs
   search/HayooSearch.hs -> src/Network/Server/Janus/Shader/HayooSearch.hs

4. Build the Janus application server by issuing the command: make janus

5. Create a "indexes" directory inside the build subdirectory under the
   Janus directory and copy the following files from the examples/hayoo 
   directory into the Janus directory:
   
   search/server.xml -> build/conf/server.xml
   search/wwwpages/* -> build/wwwpages/
   hayoo-index.bin -> build/indexes/hayoo-index.bin
   hayoo-docs.bin -> build/indexes/hayoo-docs.bin
   hayoo-cache.db -> build/indexes/hayoo-cache.db

6. Start the Janus application by issuing ./janus in the build
   subdirectory inside the Janus directory.

7. Point your browser to http://localhost:8080
