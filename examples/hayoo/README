About
-----

Hayoo! is a highly interactive Haskell API search engine, providing
sophisticated features like find-as-you-type, suggestions and
fuzzy queries.

Requirements
------------

- hslogger 1.0.5
- Holumbus 0.4
- Janus 1.0

Installation
------------

Unfortunately, the installation is quite fiddly. In the following,
the exact procedure is described in detail.

1. Install hslogger like any other Haskell package.

2. Download the Janus application server and unzip in a directory
   of your choice.
   
3. Download the Holumbus framework and unzip in a directory of
   your choice. Follow the included installation instructions to
   install the Holumbus core library.

4. Copy the following files from the examples/hayoo directory into
   the Janus directory:
   
   HayooHelper.hs -> src/HayooHelper.hs
   search/HayooParser.hs -> src/HayooParser.hs
   search/HayooSearch.hs -> src/Network/Server/Janus/Shader/HayooSearch.hs

5. Build the Janus application server by issuing the command: make janus

6. Create a "indexes" directory inside the build subdirectory under the
   Janus directory and copy the following files from the examples/hayoo 
   directory into the Janus directory:
   
   search/server.xml -> build/conf/server.xml
   search/wwwpages/* -> build/wwwpages/
   hayoo-index.bin -> build/indexes/hayoo-index.bin
   hayoo-docs.bin -> build/indexes/hayoo-docs.bin
   hayoo-cache.db -> build/indexes/hayoo-cache.db

7. Start the Janus application by issuing ./janus in the build
   subdirectory inside the Janus directory.

8. Point your browser to http://localhost:8080
